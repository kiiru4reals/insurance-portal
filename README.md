# insurance_portal

Complementary Flutter Web Application and Linux Desktop Application for the [insurance client](https://github.com/kiiru4reals/insurance-client.git) project. 
This is where all the magic happens :). I would rate the Web Application environment for Flutter to be a 6/10, use other frameworks if you really need to build on the web but steer clear of Flutter.

## Features
- Login email and password
- Add new policies for vehicle, life and travel
- Create and add new administrative users
- See clients information depending on the insurance policies.
- Not a feature but worth mentioning(The dark mode is on point)
